### Deduplication Strategy

Use embeddings to merge similar facts:
1. Embed all facts from both sources
2. Compare pairwise similarity
3. If similarity > 0.90 → same fact → keep most detailed version
4. Result: comprehensive, deduplicated fact set

Example merge:
- Perplexity: "5% off with Circle Card"
- Firecrawl: "Extra 5% off Free, fast shipping"
- Merged: "Circle Card: 5% off everything + free fast shipping"
